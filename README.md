# Bus Ticket Booking System

## Description

This project is a Bus Ticket Booking System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It is a conversion of a C project from the first semester into a C++ project for the third semester of a Bachelor of Computer Technology (BCT) program. The system allows users to register, login, view available buses, book seats, cancel bookings, and display booking details.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Users can register and login to the system.
- **Bus Management:** Display available buses, book seats, cancel bookings, and display booking details.
- **OOP Concepts:** The project utilizes classes, objects, inheritance, operator overloading, and file handling.

  - `ConsoleColor`: Handles text color changes in the console.
  - `Bus`: Represents a bus with an ID, capacity, and seat availability.
  - `User`: Base class for users with registration and login functionality.
